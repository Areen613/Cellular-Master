        Here are answers to some of the questions we hear most often in the shop. If you still
        wonder about something after reading this, feel free to call or drop by – we are happy
        to explain things in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every device and situation is slightly different, so the information below is a general
        guide. Final pricing and delays are always confirmed after we inspect your phone or tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
        For very special models or heavy damage, we may need extra time for parts or advanced
        diagnostics. In those cases we will always ask for your approval before continuing.

        <summary>Do you offer warranty on repairs?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Most repairs come with warranty on both parts and labour. The exact duration
          depends on the type of repair and the part used, and it is written on your invoice.
          Physical damage or liquid damage after the repair is not covered.
        </p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How long does a typical repair take?</summary>
        <p>
          Simple iPhone screen or battery replacements can often be done the same day, sometimes
          within an hour if parts are in stock. More complex jobs, board work or rare models may
          require one or several days. We will give you an estimated delay once we see the device.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I need to back up my data?</summary>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, we recommend backing up your data before any repair. In many cases
          we can complete the repair without touching your data, but accidents, old hardware or
          previous damage can always create risks. A backup keeps you safe.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can you repair liquid damage?</summary>
        <p>
          We can often clean and recover devices that had contact with water or other liquids,
          but success is not guaranteed. The sooner you bring the device after the incident,
          the better the chances. Please avoid charging or turning it on repeatedly.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can you give a price over the phone?</summary>
        <p>
          For common models and issues we can give a rough idea of the cost range by phone.
          However, final pricing is only confirmed after we open and inspect the device, because
          hidden damage is very common – especially with drops and liquid.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do you repair devices that are very old or uncommon?</summary>
        <p>
          Sometimes. If parts are still available and the repair is safe, we are happy to help.
          In other cases, the price of the part can be higher than the value of the device. We
          will be honest about that and help you decide whether repair is a good idea or not.
